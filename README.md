# Secrets of the Moon Game for Minetest

Secrets of the moon is a game about discovering what the moon is made of by
excavating it. It was made in less than a week for the [Minetest 2022 GAME
JAM](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=28802) and features many
original assets: sounds, textures, a model and even a little bit of music..
